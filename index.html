          </h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="list"><b>1914</b> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the 
            University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known 
            as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1935</b> - Has to stop school and save up more 
            money. Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving 
            Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this 
            left scars on me."</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1937</b> - Finishes university and takes a job 
            in the US Forestry Service</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret 
            Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles 
            Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who teaches him 
            about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1941</b> - Tries to enroll in the military after 
            the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military 
            asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, 
            disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1942</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant 
            Pathology</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1944</b> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from 
            Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to 
            head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his 
            team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - 
            including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1945</b> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice 
            each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1953</b> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of 
            wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that 
            responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's 
            wheat.</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings his 
            high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time 
            to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding 
            population</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1970</b> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1983</b> - helps seven African countries 
            dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>
          <li class="list"><b>1984</b> - becomes a distinguished professor at 
            Texas A&M University</li>
          <li class="list"><b>2005</b> - states "we will have to double the 
            world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops 
            are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable 
            land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because 
            "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long 
            time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the 
            best breeds."</li>
          <li class="list"><b>2009</b> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
